RECIPE:
1.Prepare 4 ramekins. Grease each ramekin with a little non-stick spray and a dusting of cocoa powder before filling with batter. This preparation helps the baked lava cake release seamlessly from the ramekin onto the plate for serving.
2.Make the chocolate cake batter.
3.Spoon the batter evenly into each ramekin.
4.Bake. The high oven temperature cooks the outside of the mini cakes but leaves the center slightly gooey. The tops may look slightly soft.
5.Invert the ramekins. Carefully flip the freshly baked lava cakes upside down onto plates.
6.Add toppings & enjoy!
